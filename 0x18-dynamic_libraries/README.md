Create the dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the functions listed below:
1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
3. Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!
I bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands 
on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?
Our mole got us a copy of the program, you can download it here. Our mole also gave us a piece of documentation.
